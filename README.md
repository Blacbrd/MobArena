This is one of the first serious Minecraft Plugins I built. It taught me how to handle entity spawning, how to use dependancy injection, how to create GUIs and how to use config files (It also taught me not to use static unless necessary!)

The current project is mostly finished, it can:

* Allow the user to change the config file to add their own mobs and how many spawn
* Be started using a command
* Spawn enemies, and know when a wave has started/ended
* Increment waves (and show a title on the screen to alert the user that the wave has finished)

I do not intend to work on this project further, however it has given me great experience in using Java
